# 🚀 Enhanced Video Sync Engine Features

## Overview

The Video Sync Engine has been enhanced with **File Sharing** and **Screen Sharing** capabilities, allowing users to participate in sync sessions in multiple ways beyond just local video files.

## 🎭 User Participation Modes

### Available Modes

1. **🎬 Local Video (`localplay`)** - Default mode
   - User has their own video file loaded locally
   - Can control playback for the entire channel
   - Traditional sync behavior

2. **📱 Share Screen (`screenshare_host`)**
   - User shares their screen/application with others
   - Screen content is synchronized across all viewers
   - Can control video playback while sharing

3. **👀 Watch Screen (`screenshare_viewer`)**
   - User watches someone else's shared screen
   - Receives real-time screen share via WebRTC
   - Cannot control playback

4. **📁 File Download (`file_download`)**
   - User is downloading a shared video file
   - Automatically switches to `localplay` when download completes
   - Can participate in sync once file is ready

5. **👁️ Observer (`observer`)**
   - User just observes the sync session
   - Cannot control playback
   - Useful for spectators or those without content

## 📤 File Sharing System

### How It Works

1. **Upload Video Files**: Users can upload video files to share with the channel
2. **Automatic Distribution**: Uploaded files become available to all channel members
3. **Progressive Download**: Users can download shared files in chunks
4. **Seamless Integration**: Downloaded files automatically integrate with sync system

### Usage

1. **Join Channel** in `localplay` mode
2. **Click "📤 Upload Video"** button
3. **Select video file** (max 500MB)
4. **Wait for upload** - progress shown in real-time
5. **Other users see notification** when file becomes available
6. **Download via "📥 Download"** button

### Supported Formats
- MP4, AVI, MOV, WMV, FLV
- Maximum file size: 500MB
- Automatic compression for optimal streaming

## 📱 Screen Sharing System

### How It Works

1. **WebRTC Technology**: Direct peer-to-peer screen sharing
2. **Quality Options**: Low (480p), Medium (720p), High (1080p)
3. **Audio Support**: Share system audio along with screen
4. **Real-time Sync**: Screen content synchronized across viewers

### Screen Sharing Usage

#### To Share Your Screen:

1. **Join Channel** and select mode **📱 Share My Screen**
2. **Choose Quality** (Low/Medium/High)
3. **Click "🚀 Start Sharing"**
4. **Grant Permission** when browser requests screen access
5. **Select Screen/Window** to share
6. **Start Broadcasting** - others will see notification

#### To Watch Someone's Screen:

1. **Join Channel** in any mode
2. **See "Available Screens"** section
3. **Click "👀 Watch"** next to desired screen
4. **Mode automatically switches** to `screenshare_viewer`
5. **Video appears** in Screen Share Viewer section

### Quality Settings

- **Low (480p)**: Best for slow connections, minimal bandwidth
- **Medium (720p)**: Balanced quality and performance (recommended)
- **High (1080p)**: Best quality, requires good internet connection

## 🔄 Smart Mode Switching

### Automatic Mode Changes

The system intelligently switches user modes based on actions:

- **Upload File** → Stays in `localplay`
- **Download File** → Switches to `file_download`
- **Start Screen Share** → Switches to `screenshare_host`
- **Watch Screen Share** → Switches to `screenshare_viewer`
- **Stop Sharing** → Switches to `observer`

### Manual Mode Changes

Users can manually change modes using the **🎭 Participation Mode** dropdown:

```
🎬 Local Video    - Play your own video file
📱 Share My Screen - Share your screen with others
👀 Watch Shared Screen - Watch someone's screen
👁️ Observer Only - Just observe the session
```

## 🎮 Enhanced Playback Controls

### Who Can Control Playback?

- **`localplay` users**: Full control (play/pause/seek)
- **`screenshare_host` users**: Full control while sharing
- **Other modes**: Cannot control playback

### Playback Indicators

All playback commands now show:
- **Triggered by**: Which user initiated the action
- **User Mode**: What mode the controlling user is in
- **Enhanced Timestamps**: NTP-synchronized timing

```

### File Sharing Flow

1. **Upload**: Client chunks file → Server stores → Notifies channel
2. **Download**: Client requests → Server provides chunks → Client reassembles
3. **Storage**: Files stored in Durable Objects (temporary, session-based)

### Screen Sharing Flow

1. **Host**: Screen capture → WebRTC offer → Server relays → Viewers
2. **Viewers**: WebRTC answer → Direct P2P connection established
3. **Streaming**: Direct peer-to-peer video/audio streaming

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### For Developers

   ```bash
   cd server-cloudflare
   npm run deploy

**"Screen sharing not supported"**:
- Use modern browser (Chrome 72+, Firefox 66+, Safari 13+)
- Ensure you're on HTTPS or localhost

### File Sharing Issues

**"Upload failed"**:
- Check file size (max 500MB)
- Ensure video format is supported
- Check internet connection

**"Download failed"**:
- Check available storage space
- Verify internet connection
- Try refreshing and retrying

### Connection Issues

**"Error invoking"**:
